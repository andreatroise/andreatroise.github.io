## PhD candidate in Aerospace Engineering

I am an Italian engineer, currently enrolled in the XXXVIII Cycle of Politecnico di Bari PhD Programme in engineering and aerospace sciences, with a grant co-funded by [Astradyne](https://www.astradyne.space/) s.r.l.

I obtained a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Polytechnic University of Bari](https://www.poliba.it/it), and a Master’s degree with honors in Mechatronic Engineering at [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/). In my studies, I learned to mix many different subjects, from mechanics to electronics, with a predilection for aerospace applications.
I consider myself a curious person, I always ask myself the reasoning behind things and put in discussion my point of view.

As you can imagine, Wall-e was my favourite Disney movie growing up...

**Welcomer @ [Borgo Egnazia](https://www.borgoegnazia.com/) (_Summer of 2017 and 2018_)**
- During my university studies, I consistently sought opportunities to gain practical work experiences and financial independence. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, I was privileged to serve as a Guest Welcomer at Borgo Egnazia, a prestigious 5-star resort nestled in the heart of Fasano, Apulia Region. This role provided me with invaluable insights and experiences, especially in a beacon of global excellence in the Apulia region.
- Over the years Borgo Egnazia has hosted many prestigious events, among them there is also the G7 in 2024.

## Space-related activities
**[Mentoring Team](https://spacegeneration.org/mentoring) Co-Lead at Space Generation Advisory Council**
- I've been passionate about space for many many years, but before starting the PhD it looked like a field very difficult to approach, especially in my region (southern Italy) and without a space-focused academical background. After beginning my PhD a new world opened up in front of me: I discovered a field that is indeed very different from my initial idea. The space sector needs interdisciplinarity and talents, now more than ever.
That is why, after discovering the amazing work carried out by the Space Generation Advisory Council in the space sector, I tried to give my small contribute in supporting students and young professionals that need guidance in their own path. That's exactly what the Mentoring Committee objective is. We match students and young professionals with senior individuals with years of expertise in the space sector, so that they can connect and enrich each other life.

In this picture, I had the honor of meeting and speaking with Franco Malerba, the first Astronaut in italian history, truly a beautiful person.

## Outside of work
**Golf**
- This typically sounds weird to many people from my region, but I have spent a lot of time playing golf in my life. As my father was deeply passionate towards this sport, I followed his steps and I took part in several national and international championships. I have also been Apulian regional champion in 2015 and 2016. Playing a sport at high level gave me the opportunity to be in high-pressure situations, where every move you make puts the overall result at stake. It's been a while since I last competed agonistically, but golf taught me so much during my teenage years. Hopefully I will start to play again someday.

**Volunteering**
- I've donated blood regularly since high school, it is just one of those things that make me feel better with myself. I attended several medical fundraising events organised by my local Lions International district. I also organised a scientific divulgation event talking about space economy and space environmental footprint (LinkedIn)[https://www.linkedin.com/events/ingegneriaescienzeaerospaziali-7149455471769272320/comments/]. I aim to give back to my community, and I will try to do it more and more in the incoming years.

**Drawings**
- Sometimes I draw stuff, I'm not good, I typically do it only to express emotions. I love Escher and his works, the spiral-y thing is actually one of his works, it is my profile picture in many social media. The spiral represents the Uroboro, a symbol of eternal return, for me it is the symbol of committment towrds the continuous improvement of myself.

**My GofundMe**
- I organised a GoFundMe to raise money to attend a summer school by the International Space University hosted by Nasa Houston Center, it was a total success.
